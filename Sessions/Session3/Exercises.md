# Functions

1. Create a function named combineStrings that takes in two strings as arguments and returns a string like this: "string1 - string2". In other words the two strings should be separated by " - ". The resulting string should be returned (not printed). 

2. Create a function named convertToCelsius that takes in an argument `degreesInFarenheit` that is a Double and returns the degrees in Celsius (also a Double).

3. Create a function similar to #2, but instead of converting to degrees it converts miles to meters.
