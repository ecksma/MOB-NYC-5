### Assignment

1. Create an Event class with the following properties
  * `eventName` as a String
  * `eventDate` as a Struct
    * the struct should be named `Date` with a month, day and year property, each of type Int
  * `priority` as an Enum
    * the enum should be named `EventPriority` with Low, Medium, and High values
  * `description` as a String
  * `isAllDay` as a Bool
  
2. Make sure your code can run without any errors
3. Take a look at this cheatsheet. Let me know if you find it helpful

4. Read through this article. Ignore the sections on tuples and start at "Protocols". This is an intermediate article, so it may be a bit more difficult to understand. We are going to cover delegates next week.
